Specification for Wonderland Text-Adventure Game:
v1.0
19.01.2018

Game idea:
A simple text-adventure game based on the story of 'Alice in Wonderland'.

The player plays as the main character Alice, as she moves into different places (rooms) in Wonderland. 
Once in a room, she has the choice to inspect her surroundings and interact with characters and items.
These interactions may result in:
- changes to her health 
- changes in her physical size (also doubling or halving her health, and unlock access to certain items)
- movement to a different room in the game

With items, she may have the option of keeping them in her inventory to be used at a later stage in the game.

Her health decreases the longer she spends in Wonderland. This is not measured by the length of time spent in 
the gameplay by the player, but is affected by the number and type of rooms she has been in.

Providing that her health remains above a set threshold, and she has gone through all the required interactions in the 
correct sequence, Alice is allowed to escape from Wonderland, thereby winning the game. Otherwise, if either her health 
has expired or a fatal sequence of choices has been chosen, the game will restart and Alice is indefinitely trapped in 
Wonderland. Here, the player will restart at 69% of the initial health.

However at any point in the game, the player may choose to end the game by drinking a 'Death Potion'. This is provided at
the initial stage of the game when Alice first enters Wonderland.

(Optional: A simple scoring system based on the choices made in the gameplay?)
